# MiDAS-Depth-Map

MiDaS computes relative inverse depth from a single image.MiDaS was trained on up to 12 datasets (ReDWeb, DIML, Movies, MegaDepth, WSVD, TartanAir, HRWSI, ApolloScape, BlendedMVS, IRS, KITTI, NYU Depth V2) with multi-objective optimization. The original model that was trained on 5 datasets (MIX 5 in the paper) can be found here. The figure below shows an overview of the different MiDaS models; the bubble size scales with number of parameters.
